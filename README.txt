All the features that are integrated into the project fully work and have been tested multiple times with different test cases. 

There are 5 different unique puzzles in the website which the user can solve and the answers for which have been provided in the Story (docx) file with each answer numbered respectively 

There exists user Signup/login and user logout capabilities all of which have been linked to tables in databases for storage and retrieval. 

Integrated with form validation capabilities so the user is able to enter the correct and required input for storage of information. 

The puzzles are all logical and can be solved through minimal effort and thinking (Highly recommend at least try solving one ;) ).

The website itself has a dark theme and is based off a Japanese folktale called "Kuchisake Onna". 

The puzzles are NOT redundant but rather from start to finish tell the story of Kuchisake Onna, her appearance, encounters and events that happen.

Different endings integrated with each having a separate path from the rest 

It also solves the information of each user that was able to solve the puzzle in 5 different tables in the database answersDB. 

It crosschecks the answers for the puzzle through a database and makes sure the correct answer was inputted
